# Fandango_project
The Fandango project is an assignment for the DTSC 580: Data Manipulation, which is part of the requirement for the award of MS in Data Science from Eastern University, Pennsylvania. This project aims at using Pandas to explore the Fandango dataset from an article and to practice some basics including merging files.
